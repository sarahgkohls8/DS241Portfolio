##Introduction
##Lehdr is an R package that allows users to LODES datasets returned as dataframes

##Installation
```{r}
devtools::install_github("jamgreen/lehdr")
library(lehdr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
```

##Usage

##First example: pulls the Oregon 2014 origin-destination, all jobs including private
##primary, secondary, and Federal, all jobs across ages, earnings, and industry, aggregated
##at the Census Tract level (rather than the default Census Block)

```{r}
or_od <- grab_lodes(state = "or", year = 2014, lodes_type = "od", job_type = "JT01", 
           segment = "S000", state_part = "main", agg_geo = "tract")

head(or_od)
```

##Package can be used to retrieve multiple states and years at the same time
##Does this by creating a vector or list

```{r}
or_ri_od <- grab_lodes(state = c("or", "ri"), year = c(2013, 2014), lodes_type = "od", job_type = "JT01", 
           segment = "S000", state_part = "main", agg_geo = "tract")     

head(or_ri_od)
```

##Not all years are available for each state
##Other common uses might include retrieving Residential or Work Area Characteristics,
##low income jobs, or good producing jobs

##Additional Examples

##Adding at County level signifiers

##The following examples loads work area characteristics
##Then uses the work area geoid to create a variable that is just the county

```{r}
md_rac <- grab_lodes(state = "md", year = 2015, lodes_type = "wac", job_type = "JT01", segment = "S000")

head(md_rac)

md_rac_county <- md_rac %>% mutate(w_county_fips = str_sub(w_geocode, 1, 5))

head(md_rac_county)
```

##Aggregating at the County level

##To aggregate at the county level, we must first drop the original lock geoid (w_geocode)
##Then we need to group by:
##our new variable (w_county_fips) 
##and existing variables (year and createdate)
##Then we need to aggregate the remaining numeric variables

```{r}
md_rac_county <- md_rac %>% mutate(w_county_fips = str_sub(w_geocode, 1, 5)) %>% 
  select(-"w_geocode") %>%
  group_by(w_county_fips, state, year, createdate) %>% 
  summarise_if(is.numeric, sum)

head(md_rac_county)
```

##Another way to do it:
```{r}
md_rac_county <- grab_lodes(state = "md", year = 2015, lodes_type = "rac", job_type = "JT01", 
           segment = "S000", agg_geo = "county")
           
head(md_rac_county)
```

##Aggregating Origin-Destination

##Aggregating origin-destination is built-in to the function
##This takes care of aggregation on both the (h_geocode) and (w_geocode) variables

```{r}
md_od_county <- grab_lodes(state = "md", year = 2015, lodes_type = "od", job_type = "JT01", 
           segment = "S000", agg_geo = "county", state_part = "main")
           
head(md_od_county)
```

##Aggregating at Block Group, Tract, or State level

##There are also built-in functions to group at Block group, Tract, County, and State

```{r}
md_rac_bg <- grab_lodes(state = "md", year = 2015, lodes_type = "rac", job_type = "JT01", 
           segment = "S000", agg_geo = "bg")
           
head(md_rac_bg)

md_rac_tract <- grab_lodes(state = "md", year = 2015, lodes_type = "rac", job_type = "JT01", 
           segment = "S000", agg_geo = "tract")
           
head(md_rac_tract)

md_rac_state <- grab_lodes(state = "md", year = 2015, lodes_type = "rac", job_type = "JT01", 
           segment = "S000", agg_geo = "state")
           
head(md_rac_state)
```
